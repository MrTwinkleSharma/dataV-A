Basic of Data Visualizing and Analyzing using SQL DATABASE, PYTHON PROGRAM and WEB PAGE

In this Project i am going to display some sort of addresses on google maps as PINs (Hover on these to view details).
These are the basic outlines for the files being used in this.
--1. A .data file **where.data** for storing the input for program
--2. A Python program **loadfromdata.py** to create a SQL Database from the address, will have 1 Table Locations with two Columns (Address, GeoData)
--3. A SQL generated file **sqldatabase.sqlite**  to store Address and GeoData Related to that address
--4. A Python program **analysingfromdata** to show the details we want
